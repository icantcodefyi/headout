## üîπ Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Next.js Application**: The main web application handling the UI, game logic, and database operations
2. **Socket.IO Server**: A standalone TypeScript server handling real-time multiplayer functionality (in the `backend` directory)

## üîπ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.0+ (recommended) or Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database

### Quick Setup

The project includes a setup script that handles installation of dependencies, database migrations, and data seeding:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/globetrotter.git
cd globetrotter

# Run the setup script
bun setup
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to run each step manually:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/globetrotter.git
   cd globetrotter
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the Next.js app and Socket.IO server:
   ```bash
   # Install Next.js app dependencies
   bun install
   
   # Install Socket.IO server dependencies
   bun socket:install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory for the Next.js app:
   ```
   # Database URL
   DB_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/globetrotter"
   
   # Next Auth
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   
   # Google OAuth
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
   
   # Socket.IO settings
   SOCKET_URL="http://localhost:4000"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL="http://localhost:4000"
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory for the Socket.IO server:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example env file
   cp backend/env.example backend/.env
   
   # Edit as needed
   nano backend/.env
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   bun db:migrate
   
   # Seed the database with destinations
   bun db:seed
   ```

5. Start the development servers:

   **Start servers separately in different terminals**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 (for Next.js app)
   bun dev
   
   # Terminal 2 (for Socket.IO server)
   bun socket:dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## üîπ Game Rules

1. You'll be presented with 1-2 cryptic clues about a famous destination.
2. Choose from multiple options to guess the correct destination.
3. Receive immediate feedback after answering:
   - Correct answer: See confetti animation and learn a fun fact
   - Incorrect answer: See a sad face and still learn something new
4. Track your score and challenge friends to beat it!

## üîπ Multiplayer Mode

The multiplayer functionality is powered by a standalone Socket.IO server that can be hosted separately from the main application.

### Deploying the Socket.IO Server

See the [Socket.IO server README](backend/README.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

Quick deployment options:

1. **Manual Deployment**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   bun build
   bun start
   ```

2. **Docker**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   docker build -t globerotter-socket .
   docker run -p 4000:4000 --env-file .env globerotter-socket
   ```

3. **Update your frontend settings**:
   ```
   # In your frontend .env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL="http://your-socket-server-domain:4000"
   ```
